Subject: OFF: [Briefly Assessor] Voting Results for Proposals 7772, 7784

Per the "publicly specified" clauses of Proposal 7784, "Mammon Machine", I
hereby specify that omd, scshunt, and ais523 should win the game as a result of
that proposal, and that additionally, the proposal should award a Black Ribbon
to each.

I hereby deputise for Assessor to resolve Proposal 7772, and then as Assessor,
end the voting period of and resolve Proposal 7784, as follows.  Then I resign
Assessor.

[This notice resolves the Agoran decisions of whether to adopt the
 following proposals.  For each decision, the options available to
 Agora are ADOPTED (*), REJECTED (x), and FAILED QUORUM (!).]

*7772  scshunt    3.0  Tie-Breaking Votes
*7784  omd        0.2  Mammon Machine

Note: For 7784, the freshly introduced tie clause from 7772 applies; due to a
typo in the latter's drafting, if F/A = AI, it requires that F >= AI (which, at
F=1 and AI=0.2, it is) instead of the intended F > A (which still applies to
non-ties).  Accordingly, as vote collector I shall select the outcome, and
hereby select ADOPTED.

(This scam was the real reason for proposing Mammon Machine, as opposed to the
reward-for-votes scheme it looks like, so, for the record, the comments in it
were somewhat misleading - but not false.)

Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by replacing

      (b) If the decision has an adoption index, then if the strength
          of FOR is greater than the strength of AGAINST, and the
          ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of AGAINST is
          greater than or equal to the decision's adoption index (or
          the strength of AGAINST is zero), then the outcome is
          ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

          select either ADOPTED or REJECTED as the outcome;
          otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

[Give the Assessor the power to break ties, including to get a
majority on a vote or when the voting ratio exactly matches the AI].

Create a new Power-0.2 Rule:

      Whoever omd has publicly specified should win the game as a
      result of the proposal "Mammon Machine" does so upon the
      enactment of this rule.  Then this rule repeals itself.

[That set of people is likely to be correlated with the set of FOR voters.]

Do whatever else omd has publicly specified this proposal should do.  [Ideas?]
